             Yesterday, App Team got to hear from ex-Apple Developer Sahand Nayebaziz, who we know for creating the powerful SwiftUI design tool called DetailsPro. Sahand and the team walked through the creation of a high traffic website from scratch using Xcode and SwiftUI. We are extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to work on real world applications of the concepts we have been learning in Academy with Sahand!

             We hope this post finds you well. First and foremost, our hearts go out to the friends and families of those impacted by the heartbreaking events at UNC over the past few days. This is a difficult time for everyone, and nobody should have to go it alone.

             Today is World Mental Health Day, and we wanted to further App Team‚Äôs commitment to ensuring that the mental health of all of you are prioritized before all else. We often forget the importance of mental health, and making sure that we are stable should always come first. Take some time today to check in on a friend or loved one and hold them close- it may mean all the world to them.

             On behalf of all of App Team Carolina, we want you to know that we, alongside the resources at the end of this post, are always available to you. No battle should be fought alone.
